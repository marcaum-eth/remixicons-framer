# Remix Icons for Framer

### Overview

As designer I was felting a necissity of using Remix Icons on our Framer project, and if you are designer probably you were feeling too, so we saw the opportunity to develop a plugin that would solve this problem.

So we created a very similar plugin to [Phosphor](https://www.framer.com/marketplace/plugins/phosphor/). 

Many thanks to [Benito](https://github.com/BenitoPedro13) that helped me a lot to built it, many thanks to [Hunter](https://github.com/huntercaron) that created for us the Phoshpor icons plugin, many thanks to all the [Remix Icons](https://remixicon.com/) team and many thanks to Copilot too! üôèüèΩü´°
